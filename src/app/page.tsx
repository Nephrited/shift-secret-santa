                    Welcome to the Shift Secret Santa (SSS) event! <br/>
                    This year we have a custom app. It&#39;s ugly. It&#39;s probably buggy! I&#39;m still working on it! But it works! <br/>
                    Users can register to give and receive either art, wishlist items, or both! <br/>

                        <li>Users must register both to give and receive a gift.</li>
                        <li>Users may supply a character reference if they wish to receive art gifts.</li>
                        <li>Users may supply an Amazon or Steam wishlist if they wish to receive purchased items.</li>
                        <li>Wishlist item purchases are limited to <em>Â£30 GBP max value.</em></li>
                        <li>Signups end on the <em>8th of December 2024.</em></li>
                        <li>Art gifts must be uploaded by the <em>24th of December 2024, UK time.</em></li>
                        <li>Proof of shipping or delivery of wishlist items must be sent directly to Nephi (nephrited) via Discord by the <em>14th of December, 2024, UK time.</em></li>

                        <li>Q: How do I provide art references?<br/>
                        A: The app will have a place to upload your references later in the week! If you want to get it done immediately, send them to Nephi.</li>
                        <li>Q: Can we provide references or wishlists for other people?<br/>
                        A: No. The event is about an exchange between people taking part, within the community. If you do not wish to receive a gift, but still wish to give, might I suggest a donation to charity?</li>
